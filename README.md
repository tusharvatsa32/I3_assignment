## Motivation
Within the ML space a significant amount of products have appeared in the last 10â€“15 years to solve some of the challenges that every company/team encounters when they want to bring to life an ML based Production system. Analyzing the full pipeline from requirements to monitoring in production we have chosen to evaluate Kubernetes, open source container orchestration founded by Google Engineers Joe Beda, Brendan Burns, and Craig McLuckie back in 2014. Given that our assignment is specifically focused on ML models in production we can assess that this product comes to play mainly in the Model Deployment stage, which we highlighted in yellow below. As it is stated, it controls the service itself and attempts to provide high availability and resilience to the system.
